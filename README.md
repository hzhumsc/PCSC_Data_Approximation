# PCSC_Data_Approximation

Group 6: Haojun Zhu

In this project, I aim to implement a method to read the input data in text files and some basic data approxiamtion algorithms in C++. Currently, there are 3 methods available:
- polynomial approximation
- piecewise polynomial approximation()
- least squares method
