# PCSC_Data_Approximation

Group 6: Haojun Zhu

In this project, I aim to implement a method to read the input data in text files and some basic data approxiamtion algorithms in C++. Currently, there are 3 methods available:
- polynomial approximation
- piecewise linear polynomial interpolation 
- piecewise cubic polynomial interpolation

If the user chooses to use the polynomial approximation method, for the data fitting, the least squares method will be applied if the degree chosen by the user is
